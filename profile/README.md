# Tricking API

## Aims to be an easy to use, consumption-only (only GET requests) API for the Tricking Vocabulary

### What is Tricking?
Tricking (or martial arts tricking) is a non-combative, dynamic sport that incorporates elements of martial arts kicking, gymnastics flipping, and breakdancing and combines them into a single, peformance-focused artform.

### Why an open-source API?
Over the years, countless trickers have attempted to build tricking apps. One pain point that they all share in the development process is expressing the Tricking Vocabulary in code. The hope with this organization is to remove the friction of building tricking based applications by providing a common api model for developers to use and build on top of.

### What is the Tricking Vocabulary?
The tricking vocabulary is the terminology used to describe movement concepts within the sport. This includes:
  - Tricks
  - Landing Stances
  - Transitions
  - Categories of Tricks
